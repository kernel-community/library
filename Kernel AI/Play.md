At Kernel, we're very interested in play. We have a [whole gaming track](https://www.kernel.community/en/build/games/), which revolves around [this article by David Graeber](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun) entitled, "What's the point if we can't have fun?".

This kind of perspective also informs our use of AI. We have found that prompting such systems - especially those controlled by corporations with their own perspective on what is acceptable or not - is most usefully done by adopting an attitude of play and the absurd. It may be that your prompt is refused if you ask it in a serious or staid manner, but if you ask the AI to produce a screenplay as if it were an improv actor, and give it the constraints and direction you're interested in, you're far more likely to discover interesting stuff together.

Along these same lines, a good friend of ours from [The Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) has asked one such model: "Provide 33 ways in which Glass Bead Game (by Hermann Hesse) relates to DeSchool (the idea that everyone can teach and learn)?".
