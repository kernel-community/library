RFC stands for [Request For Comments](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2555.txt). It is a venerable method of digital organisation, collaboration, and collective intelligence work.

In line with how we [play with pattern in Kernel](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern), you will not find single answers to the questions documented on this page. 

However, we do ask that you **document any questions you ask that do not receive either (i) any response or (ii) an adequate response** (more subjective). We will then discuss them, share any insights we might have to said questions on this page, create new embeddings based on those insights, update the existing model, and ensure that anyone else who asks a similar question is more directly responded to. 

This way, we all continue to learn together, in dialogue, across time.

During training, we asked one such question which has no direct correlate in the current website content. Th model responded in the stock standard way:

### What is the complementary opposite of manipulation?

> The document does not provide an answer to this question.

Now, seeing this, we know that something which is clear to the original author of Kernel is not actually consciously presented anywhere on the website. This is how we can consistently improve what we teach and (much harder until now!) identify what is missing from the course.

Depending on the context, complementary opposites of manipulation include sincerity and gift-giving. When I consciously use sincere language, there is always already an element of the performative in it, just as when I give you a gift, it can be interpreted in multiple ways. To be sincere requires that you understand how to induce another being to suspend disbelief (which can be used for negative purposes). True sincerity also requires vulnerability, because it is born from the realisation that it is only by exposing your own, particular truth (even if in a highly performative way) that you can create conditions conducive to the suspension of disbelief in an other. And, if you're truly living your particular truth, then you need not impose it on anyone else because you have discovered you are already enough - just as you are - and so the need or incentive to manipulate others simply dissolves. The same is true of gift-giving: a point best made in [Module 7 by Daisetz Suzuki](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-7/the-gift/#one-last-link).
