There's a lot of excitement about Large Language Models (LLM) and their potentially diverse applications.

Working with [Algovera](https://app.algovera.ai/), an open source organization started by a Kernel fellow, we have created a "conversational model" using all the content in Kernel. 

Such models are only as insightful as the data they are trained on, and it is our hope that we can - by using lessons refined in community over many years - begin with a stable enough foundation to play increasingly wise, collaborative, and infinite games with our ever-improving tools.

We provide a list of [[Questions and Answers]] we have already put to the model. This serves two functions:

1. Many of these questions provide accessible summaries of large parts of what we teach and may be easier to learn from in certain contexts.
2. These serve as good examples for you to start learning how to craft your own prompts when talking with the model yourself.

Our ask is very simple:
