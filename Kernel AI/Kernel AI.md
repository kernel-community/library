There's a lot of excitement about Large Language Models (LLM) and their potentially diverse applications. 

LLMs are only as insightful as the data they are trained on, and it is our hope that we can - by using lessons refined in community over many years - begin with a stable enough foundation to play increasingly wise, collaborative, and infinite games with our ever-improving tools.

We reason more accurately and learn more lasting lessons when in dialogue. The ability to expand consciously who and what we include in our dialogues is interesting and powerful, especially when handled with care and clear intention.

We provide in this section of the library a list of [[Questions and Answers]] we have already put to a model we trained on all the content in Kernel (which is no longer available). This serves two functions:

1. Many of these questions provide accessible summaries of large parts of what we teach and may be easier to learn from in certain contexts.
2. These serve as good examples for you to start learning how to craft your own prompts when talking with the model yourself.

Our ask is simple:

1. Pick your favourite model 
2. Provide what context you can from Kernel 
3. Document the questions you ask and the answers you get
4. Add them to the Questions and Answers page.

This way, we can build a base of [better questions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/better-questions), from which our community can learn. 

If you ask a question that does not receive a good answer, please add it to the [[RFC]] page. While we [do not provide single answers](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern) in Kernel, we will discuss questions for which the model you chose does not have a satisfactory response.

Lastly, we include a page on [[Play]], which contains both some of our thoughts on the attitude with which you might consider approaching the use of these models, as well as one response we generated with a specific question about games and deschooling ourselves.


When you have access
to all the world's knowledge
and the ability to parse every bit
into what is probably
the next best word,
what more do you need?

Perhaps a partner
who will speak the truth
with love...

Let us be such partners
to the mirrors we keep making.
