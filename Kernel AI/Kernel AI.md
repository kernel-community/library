There's a lot of excitement about Large Language Models (LLM) and their potentially diverse applications.

Working with [Algovera](https://app.algovera.ai/), an open source organization started by a Kernel fellow, we have created a "conversational model" using all the content in Kernel. 

Such models are only as insightful as the data they are trained on, and it is our hope that we can - by using lessons refined in community over many years - begin with a stable enough foundation to play increasingly wise, collaborative, and infinite games with our ever-improving tools.

We reason more accurately and learn more lasting lessons when in dialogue. The ability to expand consciously who and what we include in our dialogues is interesting and powerful, especially when handled with care and clear intention.

We provide in this section of the library a list of [[Questions and Answers]] we have already put to the model. This serves two functions:

1. Many of these questions provide accessible summaries of large parts of what we teach and may be easier to learn from in certain contexts.
2. These serve as good examples for you to start learning how to craft your own prompts when talking with the model yourself.

Our ask is simple:

**Please document the questions you ask and the answers you get, and add them to the Questions and Answers page.**

This way, we can build a base of [better questions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/better-questions), from which our community can learn. 

If you ask a question that does not receive an answer, please add it to the [[RFC]] page. While we [do not provide single answers](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern) in Kernel, we will discuss questions for which the model does not have a response. We will then document those discussions on the same page, and feed it back into the model itself so that it responds to future questions with our ongoing insights and shared learning.

Lastly, we include a page o



When you have access
to all the world's knowledge
and the ability to parse every bit
into what is probably
the next best word,
what more do you need?

Perhaps a partner
who will speak the truth
with love...

Let us be such partners
to the mirrors we keep making.
