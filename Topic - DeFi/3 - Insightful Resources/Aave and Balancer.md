We recommend reading [this flipside crypto report on DAO to DAO collaboration](https://data.flipsidecrypto.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Flipside-Governance-Analysis-of-a-DAO-to-DAO-Partnership.pdf) between Aave and Balancer.

>Community members of these two DAOs saw something profound in what the  other had to offer. Some complimentary capability paired with the deep expertise and  trust that comes from time-tested smart contracts.

This report will give you good insight first into what Aave and Balancer actually are and smattering of the history about how they came to be. It provides some high-level data-driven insights into what the protocols do and how well they do it. 

It is really interesting to see the difference between Uniswap (an [[2. AMMs|AMM]] made up of pools that only have two types of tokens) and Balancer (An "Automated Portfolio Manager" made up of pools with up to 8 different kinds of token) and how this translates to differences in both the TVL and the strategy that these different protocols adopt.

In detailing some of the history, FC also does a good job of describing Balancer's move toa "voting escrow" system similar to Curve, which they describe in greater detail [here](https://medium.com/flipside-governance/to-ve-or-not-to-ve-9e3d14d4ccc5).

The data that they are able to gather and present is really interesting and will provide you with many more insights than the report itself if you consider it deeply and take your time to reflect on some of it. 

For instance, FC makes the point that only 0.7% of the circulating supply of Aave has been involved (ever!) in voting on proposals, but then seems to forget this later when analysing the governance process (a forum + snapshot proposals), saying:

>Over 151 on-chain and 496 Snapshot polls have occurred to make Aave what it is today. Active governance at its finest.

This seems to us to illustrate some of the deep, architectural problems in how we conceive of token-holder governance today (in 2023). [Kernel recommends a different model](https://www.kernel.community/en/tokens/#the-cost-of-decisions) in which funds are distributed *by virtue of how governance works*, rather than after the fact of a vote being taken by a few, well-resourced people.
