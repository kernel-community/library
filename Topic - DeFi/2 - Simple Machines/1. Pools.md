At its simplest, a pool is a collection of one kind of asset.

Generally speaking, if you have that kind of asset, you can add it to the pool (as with all simple machines in DeFi, it is only powerful when open and permissionless).

Generally speaking, when you add your asset to the pool, you get some token in return to represent the position you now have in the pool. 

## Wrapped Tokens

The best example of this kind of machine is WETH, or Wrapped Ether. ETH is the native token of the Ethereum network itself (which denominates transaction fees in ETH), whereas every other fungible token adheres to the ERC20 standard. This means that ETH does not have the same interface as other fungible tokens, which can be a problem for particular kinds of applications built on top of Ethereum that rely on all fungible tokens having a common set of functions (i.e. 'exposing the same interface'). Therefore, some folks created an ERC20-compliant contract called WETH, which accepts ETH and "wraps" it, returning the exact amount of WETH (and ERC20 representation of ETH) to the account that sent ETH into the pool.

## Liquidity Pools 

From this simple idea of "put some token in, get another token out" we can build increasingly complex series of interactions. The next kind of pool to learn about is often called a "Liquidity Pool". Here, the pool generally contains two kinds of tokens, for instance: DAI and ETH.

In order to contribute to the pool, you need to add both DAI and ETH, in the same ratio as currently exists in the pool. In return for this, you will receive another token with represents your position as a Liquidity Provider, or LP. 

This token is often another ERC20 token, which can then be traded on secondary markets. Trading LP tokens is often at the heart of what is known as "yield farming" in DeFi. However, the token which represents  the liquidity you added need not be fungible. It could, for instance, be an NFT, as in the case of [[UniSwap V3]].
