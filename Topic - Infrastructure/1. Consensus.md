The "consensus layer" is the new layer we added to Ethereum 2.0 with "The Merge". It is otherwise known as the "Beacon Chain". We'll begin by quoting [Ben Edgington's book](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/consensus/preliminaries/) to give ourselves a grounded sense of what consensus is:

-   **Consensus is a way to build reliable distributed systems with unreliable components**.
-   Blockchain-based distributed systems aim to agree on a single history of transactions.
-   Proof of work and proof of stake are not consensus protocols, but enable consensus protocols.
-   Many blockchain consensus protocols are "forkful".
-   Forkful chains use a fork choice rule, and sometimes undergo reorganisations.
-   In a "safe" protocol, nothing bad ever happens.
-   In a "live" protocol, something good always happens.
-   No practical protocol can be always safe and always live.

If you'd like to go deeper, [here at the running notes of all consensus implementers' calls](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion), by Ben Edgington. If you scroll down the list a little further, you'll see some "[What's New In Eth2](https://eth2.news)" posts, which have consistently been a favourite of mine. Ben wrote 100 editions - truly a work of great and enduring commitment.
