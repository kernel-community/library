### Resources

If you'd like to go deeper, [here at the running notes of all consensus implementers' calls](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion), by Ben Edgington. If you scroll down the list a little further, you'll see some "[What's New In Eth2](https://eth2.news)" posts, which have consistently been a favourite round here. Ben wrote 100 editions - truly a work of great and enduring commitment.
