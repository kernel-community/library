There have been many debates about the way to approach the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, especially as it relates to data. One interesting proposal was called ["Eth1 and Done"](https://ethresear.ch/t/phase-one-and-done-eth2-as-a-data-availability-engine/5269). It was thinking like this, and the ([surprising](https://twitter.com/jinglejamOP/status/1310718738417811459)) success of parallel work on rollups and STARKs which eventually led us to the current "[rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)"

At first, we thought the way to scale Ethereum was to "shard" it all. "Sharding" is a term used when working with big data, where you cut up the DB into lots of small pieces and have each piece do stuff only related to the data it is responsible for storing. You then need some way of making sure that all the different "shards" can occasionally exchange relevant updates with one another so that, if data in one shard reference data in another and gets updated, that other shard can be aware of it.

This was the line of thinking that led to the development of the beacon chain, which was originally intended to be the thing that helped all the different shards talk to one another about stuff happening to the data they were responsible for storing and updating.
