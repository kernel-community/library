[AppChains are coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw_tWvg7Ph4). This talk highlights how some of the drawbacks of "App Chains" as they have been implemented so far (in Cosmos, for instance) can be largely solved with Validity Rollups like Starknet. The properties of such Validity rollups mean that you can maintain security, still get a large degree of composability, and make it almost as simple to deploy your own App Chian as it currently is to deploy a contract on an existing Layer 1 or 2 network.

The difference between Validity Rollups and Cosmos is instructive here. Validators on an app chain in Cosmos can still collude and thereby degrade the security properties of that specific chain, whereas Validity Rollups make sure that each app chain inherits the underlying security of the layer 1, because the results of any computation are always povably correct. We recommend Eli Ben-Sasson's talk, which is described in [[Infra Resources]] in more detail.

Given that App Chains are coming in many different forms across ecosystems, it's important that we understand some of the more cutting edge cryptographic work on this, for which we turn to [Gideon Kaempfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VBP6-6A7eA), in order to understand not just the roots of prover-verifier cryptographic systems, but how they might be built **recursively**. "Recursive" meeans that we can prove the verification of a proof. Which is interesting, because we can prove a bunch of things, and the prove the verification of all those proofs simultaneously, so you do all sorts of things, prove the outputs to be valid, and then prove that validity across all the different verifications in a single proof.
