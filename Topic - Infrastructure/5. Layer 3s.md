[AppChains are coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw_tWvg7Ph4). This talk highlights how some of the drawbacks of "App Chains" as they have been implemented so far (in Cosmos, for instance) can be largely solved with Validity Rollups like Starknet. The properties of such Validity rollups mean that you can maintain security, still get a large degree of composability, and make it almost as simple to deploy your own App Chian as it urrently is to deploy a contract on an existing Layer 1 or 2 network.

The difference between Validity Rollups and Cosmos is instructive here. Validators on an app chain in Cosmos can still collude and thereby degrade the security properties of that specific chain, whereas Validity Rollups make sure that each app chain inherits the underlying security of the layer 1, because the results of any computation are always povably correct. We recommend Eli Ben-Sasson's talk, which is described in
