We list on this page the best resources we know to get you up to speed on what different layers really are, how they imagine scaling blockchains so that they can serve global (and inter-planetary) needs, and the different approaches being taken. Of course, our own biases will show through, as this is a highly curated list not really meant to give you a technical lesson, but rather to unearth (as with all things in Kernel) the "deep why". Why are we doing this particular work, what does it truly mean, and how will it help us co-create more valuable ways of living together?

## Ethereum 2.0

Start with [the actual book, by Ben Edgington](https://eth2book.info/latest/). Ben has been a critical and eloquent part of the development efforts since the start.

## Live in the Layers

[Eli Ben-Sasson - STARK End Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L0CJmhQvc ) - we recommend beginning with this talk from a remarkable cryptographer, which provides a sweeping overview of the application of prover-verifier systems to problems in computer science, Bitcoin, blockchains, and now StarkNet. 

Understanding how the two lineages of **cryptographic prover-verifier constructions** (a small, unpowerful but reliable PC can verify the output of a large "herd" of cupercomputers) and **byzantine-fault tolerant systems** like Bitcoin and - in particular - Ethereum (which is the small, unpowerful computer we can trust to be reliable and therefore do these verifications for us) is critical. Everything about Validity Rollups hinges on this rather simple concept. It's also invigorating to watch Eli link this to deeper notions of **integrity** and hear him bring it all together when describing the work he has been doing for more than two decades.
