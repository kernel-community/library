[Kernel Module 6](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-6) begins to ask this question in a number of dimensions, most of which skirt the deeply technical. This is because it is still being built and there are some outstanding questions and thorny debates. Nevertheless, the work has advanced far enough to allow us to explore the technical dimension here with more specificity than ever before.
