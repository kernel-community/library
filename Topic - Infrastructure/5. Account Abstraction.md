You have a smartphone and, probably, a smart TV. Now, we want to make "smart wallets". It's great for user experience, and it gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of what accounts really are, and how we can use them.

**Account abstraction is the ability to program the key functionality of your account**.

Currently, you get a twelve or twenty-four word secret phrase (or some other version of a private key) that you must remember at all costs, otherwise you lose your account. The stakes are high and the learning curve steep and scary. Instead of relying only on keys, which are tightly coupled to Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) on Ethereum, we can make all addresses into smart contracts only. This means your account is a smart contract, which can be programmed to provide and protect access in various ways which are much more flexible and do not depend only upon one critical seed phrase.

Making every account into a smart contract only, and removing EOAs, requires pretty deep protocol chanes to Ethereum. Therefore, this work (encapsulat)

This talk is included for an example of the application of Account Abstraction, rather than for specific details on the EIP.
