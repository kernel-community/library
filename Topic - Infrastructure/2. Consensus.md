The "consensus layer" is the new layer we added to Ethereum 2.0 with "The Merge". It is otherwise known as the "Beacon Chain". We'll begin by quoting [Ben Edgington's book](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/consensus/) to give ourselves a grounded sense of what consensus is:

1. **Consensus is a way to build reliable distributed systems with unreliable components**.
2. Blockchain-based distributed systems aim to agree on a single history of transactions.
3. Proof of work and proof of stake are not consensus protocols, but enable consensus protocols.
4. Many blockchain consensus protocols are "forkful".
5. Forkful chains use a fork choice rule, and sometimes undergo reorganisations.
6. In a "safe" protocol, nothing bad ever happens.
7. In a "live" protocol, something good always happens.
8. No practical protocol can be always safe and always live.

We have already learnt that there are two approaches to [[1. Execution|Execution]], one of which is a "data availability consensus game". This is basically what we are playing when we separate the consensus layer from the layer on which transactions actually get executed. Since consensus is no longer concerned with transaction validity, verification amounts to checking data availability. That is, validators in the Beacon Chain only check that all the data in a given bundle is actually available: they leave the execution of the transactions (and its validity) to the execution layer. The checks consensus layer validators perform are done via [data availability sampling](https://www.youtube.com/live/xuLyZaty9iI?t=1388), which (after full danksharding) will allow validators to verify availability without having to download the entire block. 

## The Details

But wait!?

The consensus protocol in EthereumÂ 2 actually "bolts together" two different consensus protocols. One is called [Casper FFG](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part2/consensus/casper_ffg), the other [LMD GHOST](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part2/consensus/lmd_ghost). The combination has become known as [Gasper](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part2/consensus/gasper).
