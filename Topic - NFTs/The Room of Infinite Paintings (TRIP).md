TRIP is a generative on-chain SVG art that is free to mint and which has an infinite supply. This alone is almost enough to earn it a mention in this section, though there is significantly more going on under the hood.

[OpenSea Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/the-room-of-infinite-paintings)
[Contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4325ac3371f5526fb4190e5b426355c141b85018#code)

As the collection approaches 1 million pieces, the paintings being minted become increasingly likely to produce more "minimal" variations. Instead of creating some ultimately arbitrary measure of rarity and then uses this to specify the "value" of a given piece, Simon de la Rouviere takes an artistic stance first - this is a piece which values minimalism as an art form - and then encodes that stance into the contract such that the work reflects it.

If you inspect the code itself, you will see exactly how this is achieved: it is all copiously described in the comments, especially around line 145 of the CollectionDescription.sol file (5 of 14 in the "Contracts" link above).

Simon's work - much like Rhea's (who is an inspiration for Simon) - investigates where "art" is really located: in the contract, in its referent, in the interaction between the two and any potential viewers, all three, or other, more exotic options most artists are yet to explore. Both Rhea and Simon combine great technical skill with deep artistic insight, and so both serve as wonderful models from whom we can all learn.

Simon is currently working on "The Logged Universe" under the auspices of [untitled frontier](https://www.untitledfrontier.studio/), which is also well worth exploring. 

This particular piece references much of his earlier thought and writing, some of the most relevant of which can be found below:
