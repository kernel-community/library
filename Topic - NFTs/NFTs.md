Non-Fungible Tokens are intended to represent unique digital items. One is not like another, and so cannot be directly exchanged. After the NFT "boom" of 2021, there is an almost overwhelming amount of information about these kind of tokens available.

Rather than try to capture it all, or lay out a bunch of dry technical definitions here that will bore you before you reach the end of this sentence, this section is inteded to gather some of the most interesting projects which we think contain specific lessons we can learn from.

Of course, "interesting" can have many different dimensions of meaning.

## Art

1. Does the NFT collection **use the blockchain in an artful manner**? Fine awareness of the affordances of the media we use to produce any art is critical.
2. Does the art **reveal something essential how we perceive**, the media through which we choose to do so, the stories we tell about life, and about the way we see and represent ourselves, both internally and to "others"?
	1. In some vital sense, moving art - no matter how "unprecedented" the medium in which it exists - always does the same thing: hold a mirror up to those who really wish to see.
3. Is there a **balance** between the different elements, both within the artwork itself, and in terms of how it balances perception with narrative with finance with "permanence" and everything else that goes along with blockchains-as-a-medium?
4. Is it **surprising**? Both in terms of the effect it has on any viewer, and in terms of what it proves us capable of doing, thinking, programming, expressing.
5. Does it have **spirit**? In other words, does challenge the boundaries, institutions, and structures of "Art"? 

These questions are a **starting point**, not a definitive list. We are not here to delimit and define what art is: we are here to [pay attention, be astonished, and learn how to tell about it](https://www.livingcompass.org/wwow/pay-attention-be-astonished-tell-about-it). As [Rhea Myers](https://outland.art/rhea-myers/) puts it, especially in relation to question 5:

>For Myers, there is no outside. There is no safe, neutral position from which to assess art, technology, capital, or anything else. Pithy hot takes about the blockchain, from both the right and the left, annoy her. In the interview for _Proof of Work_ she says, “I have a genuine anger for imaginary solutions that are not critical or even prefigurative, that are nothing more than affordable hobbies for those who use them to resolve the merely psychological contradictions of their own existence as agents of the social reproduction of the ideology of capitalism.” A lot of art exists, according to Myers, simply to assuage the anxiety of liberals who can decode reassuring symbols then go merrily on their way without ever confronting their entanglement in systems they claim to oppose. The transparency and pragmatism of the blockchain, if taken to its logical conclusion, is something that could genuinely threaten this way of being.

Of course, Rhea and my perspective is not the only one (thank God!). Maybe "interesting" means something entirely different to you. Maybe it's about fun, maybe it's about [changing the arc of history](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1445468399656595456). Maybe it's about something unrelated to any of what is written above. If so, please edit, change, or add to this note!

Our current list of interesting projects looks like this:

1. [[89 Seconds Atomized]]
2. Basically everything done by [[Rhea Myers]]
3. [[Clovers]]
4. [[Terraforming Hypercastles]]
5. [[Nouns]]
6. [[The Room of Infinite Paintings (TRIP)]]
7. [[FInding the Blue Book]]
8. [[Exodus 2]]
9. [[Amulets]]
10. [[EET]]
11. [[The Mesh]]

We also maintain a running list of interesting [[Art Collectives]] worth following. 

## "Real World" Assets

However, we encourage you to add any dimension of "interestingness" you like! NFTs don't have to be about "serious" art in any way, shape, or form. In fact, NFTs might not even have anything to do with art! 

I've thought about vehicle registries using NFTs; people have created property registries in various parts of the world; there are NFT loyalty programs; [[Uniswap V3]] uses NFTs to represent positions in liquidity pools. There are a plethora of uses cases outside "art" which are interesting in their own ways, and we'd love for you to add notes about ones which strike you as particularly relevant here.
