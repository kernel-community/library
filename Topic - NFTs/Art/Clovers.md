Colvers was one of the first on-chain games the final state of which is an NFT collectible.

This is a powerful idea that interests us at Kernel, especially as it relates to the question of how and when to archive content as we build up [Reference Objects, in line with Illich's idea of deschooling society](https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-metta/build-native-altars/#opportunity-webs).

The concept is simple. Your browser plays a game of Othello. The end result of that game is some confirguration of the board, which you can choose to collect as an NFT or not. Clovers defines "symmetrical" NFTs as being more valuable, because they are provably more rare.

Clovers then provides a profile, a garden, and a feed via which you can find, collect, curate, and sell Clovers. Billy Renekamp even built a "pig", which is essentially a background process you can keep running in your browser which will "sniff out" and find rare clovers for you while you do other work.

When it was first released, it quickly gathered a community of active participants and we saw a fascinating market forming around different kinds of symmetries, as well as all sorts of artisitic debate about the beauty of some non-symmetrical but very eye-catching finds.

Clovers was stopped on Ethereum once gas prices rose too high to justify minting all but the most symmetrical. It was an insightful lesson in the way transaction fees can wreak havoc with the long tail of a market-game, which is so necessary to its sustainability from a community interest perspective.

While Clovers was discontinued and Billy moved on to Cosmos, where he has been focusing on [better account coordinators](https://billyrennekamp.medium.com/account-coordinator-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-wallets-9fc54032a202), many have followed in his footsteps, from [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) to smaller experiments like [Connect4]([https://twitter.com/0xSwaHili/status/1615978291093188611](https://twitter.com/0xSwaHili/status/1615978291093188611)).
