EXODUS 2 is a series of 19 pangram haikus composed by David Rudnick between 2010 and 2011. A pangram is a sentence which contains every letter of the alphabet, so putting together this strict constraint with the highly-structured form of a haiku requires a great degree linguistic precision _and_ flexibility.
  
The "About" page on [the website](https://exodus-ii.folia.app/) will tell you that each NFT is "locked in a custom smart contract in an inverse fibonacci sequence, with the final work unlocked 40 years from the first. " That is, the contract immutably encodes releases of collectible haikus according to the fibonacci sequence. The last one will become available in 40 years.

This is all about [[Time as a Platform]], coupled with our ability to represent it with linguistic dexterity and grace.
  
Each work unlocks individually and automatically when its timer reaches zero. Once unlocked, a 24hr auction sequence is triggered with no reserve. New high bids in the last 15 minutes extend the auction timer by a further 15 minutes until close. If no bids are received in the 24 hours, the work is automatically sent by the contract to a wallet held by the artist.

Playing with contractual time allows us to create new forms of stories, art, and reflections.
