I am thoroughly enjoying what is unfolding in the Logged Universe by Untitled Frontiers, which is led by Simon de la Rouviere. His work on [[The Room of Infinite Paintings (TRIP)]] and [[Time as a Platform]] - along with many, many other pieces over the years - continues to inspire me. 

This note points to only one story from what will be many in times to come: [Little Martians and the Human Memorial Monument](https://www.untitledfrontier.studio/blog/logged-universe-3-little-martians-amp-the-human-memorial-monument). 

I feel that this is a fascinating collection of NFTs because of (i) the related, but diffuse, universe within which it occurs, (ii) the multiple different kinds of media in which it exists, and which exist around it (podcast, youtube video, epub, pdf, mobi, static cover art, video cover), all of which are anchored somehow to the chain and (iii) the [unique moment in time Simon and Vanessa chose to make the on chain little martians available](https://littlemartians.untitledfrontier.studio/).

The quality and depth of thought and technical skill behind the work that is coming to forming the Logged Universe is an inspiration from which I continue to learn.
