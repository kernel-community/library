>Myers was making art that engages with the blockchain before NFTs were invented, and one gets the sense that her explorations will continue long after the current paradigms of crypto art have become obsolete. Myers is an artist with a wry sense of humor who still takes ideas seriously. Like a line of code studiously carrying out commands to the letter, she follows concepts to their conclusions, whether they’re absurd, profound, or both.

Rhea was one of the first artists to take Bitcoin and its artistic affordances seriously. She is a pioneer in the realm of blockchain art, and that is not limited to Ethereum. She has done amazing work on Bitcoin, DogeCoin, Ethereum and in various other less-explored places.

We highly [recommend this article](https://outland.art/rhea-myers/) if you want to explore the breadth and depth of her work. On a personal level, _This Contract is Art_ opened my mind to so many new possibilities when I first saw it.

> So many debates about the blockchain get caught in the ethics or practicality of its potential uses, and how those uses may or may not scale. Myers takes a different approach. She sees in the blockchain a technology where a cypherpunk political objective—that privacy is essential for an open society—is baked into the code, and the only way to truly understand the implications of this development, for better or worse, is to play them out.
