>A Chat-and-Image-Based Blockchain Oracle for Communicating with the Unseen World through Art.

>I hope through this project that people many years from now will be able to feel our reaction to our time, however insignificant it might be — the confusion, the struggle, the optimism and humor of healing the world, and the positive attitude behind the cry for help to the unknown world…

One of the most innovative uses of various aspects of the blockchain we have seen so far is _EET_, a collaboration between [Cai Guo-Qiang](http://caiguoqiang.com/) and [Kanon](https://kanon.art/).

From a technical perspective _EET_ is the first NFT project to figure out how to put GIFs entirely on chain. 

>By developing the technology to generate and store GIFs onchain, Cai and Kanon are hoping to make a lasting contribution to the growing body of open-source tools available for artistic expression on the blockchain.

It also illustrates an interesting, artistic, and multidimensional use of "oracles", playing extensively with what that word really means, especially in the context of Chinese thought, philosophy and history. 

>Pairing the mechanism from the world’s oldest oracle, I-Ching, with the tools of blockchain technology, the _EET_ smart contract combines question, context, and user-generated randomness into an _EET Fortune_.

The way this project is described also illustrates the power (and necessity) of cross-disciplinary and croos-cultural collaboration. It is uplifting in so many ways.

>Time and again throughout the development process Cai continually showed us that the creative potential of smart contracts and the blockchain was far more powerful than we had ever imagined.

Given its diverse origins, the skills required to create it, and the perspectives and depth of participation that has gone into its implementation, it is no surprise that

>The concept of EET goes beyond its technology and the crypto market. In the end, EET is not only about predicting the future, it’s about challenging users to think about the effort that would be required to change the future we are currently oriented towards.

In general, going beyond the current tech and market beliefs is a mark of the work done by Kanon, who began by creating an interesting way to [store more data in an NFT](https://medium.com/kanon-log/unleashing-god-mode-for-all-nfts-f432955b4c42) by associating it with the extra `data` param in the `safeTransfer` function. They have since used this kind of thinking to enable all sorts of other use cases, exemplified by their work on [RQDQ](https://twitter.com/KanonDotArt/status/1527596321661943808).
