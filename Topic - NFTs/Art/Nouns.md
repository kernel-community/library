There has been considerable interest in Nouns from Kernel fellows since they launched. You can find a conversation, and some resources which emerged from it, [here](https://www.kernel.community/en/build/tokenomics/nouns).

Nouns is another project which opted for a predominantly on-chain approach, releasing one unique image per day and auctioning it off to the highest bidder. It has been a runaway success. Simply check out the [website here](https://nouns.wtf/).

Interestingly, Nouns is a DAO and so their NFT contracts have some really unique innovations. In fact, their [contracts are so well-written and documented](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/) that they have served as the foundation for numerous forks and adaptions since then: from near-direct copies like [Public Nouns](https://publicnouns.wtf/) to work done by Kernel Fellows like [Prison Art](https://www.kernel.community/en/build/token-studies/restoring-justice).

Nouns adapted the [Compound Governance framework](https://compound.finance/governance) and made it suitable for NFTs, rather thn ERC20 tokens (which is the kind of token Compound uses for voting). They also adapted the Zora Auction House for the auctions they run on each noun daily, making some interesting changes (not least of which is that every 10th noun is not sold, but allocated directly to the DAO).

Nouns don't really represent "interesting" artwork in the sense of some of the other projects listed here, but their social dynamics, and the effect their work is having on popular culture, licensing debates, novel approaches to CCO, and many other topics is profound.
