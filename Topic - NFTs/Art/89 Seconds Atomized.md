This was the first project done by [snark.art](), who have gone on to do a range of really fascinating work that it is well worth wandering through at some stage.

You can find the [full white-paper here](https://snark.art/89seconds/assets/artworks/89seconds/89-seconds-Atomized-White-Paper.pdf). We think it's pretty cool that they took the trouble of writing a whole paper for a single project. If that's not your thing, watch [this 4m33s video of Eve explaining the work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzLLHUqQnE).

The idea itself is fairly simple though:

1. Get an acclaimed video artist - Eve Sussman - to "shatter" her last artist's proof (a high-res video) of a work she had previously done. 
2. By "shatter", we mean break the video up into 2304 20x20 pixel squares - tiny little snippets of the original.
3. The only way the video can be put back together is if all the owners come together and stage their pieces as one.

>Where 89 seconds at Alcázar sought to enter  the frame of the painting itself, 89 seconds, Atomized, dives  into the the pixels of video itself.

>Each 20x20 pixel atom is itself a unique piece of art that can  be viewed irrespective of the whole.

That's cool and kinda in line with what we might expect from blockchains, but here comes the truly surprising, spirited, and interesting part:

> While each video atom will be a one-of-a-kind, induplicable art piece, we believe that the work — both individually and  collectively — becomes truly meaningful, and extraordinary,  in the community that it creates. And offering a unique mode of shared ownership will give the artwork a second life,  allowing it to be far more accessible to a general audience,  as well as evolving the meaning of the piece itself.

There is also an extended awareness of the way blockchains are used in the world, and how this may play a role in the shared ownership they outline above:

>Of course, some pieces may be lost over time, or certain  owners may not wish to participate in screenings — as a  result, the video image itself becomes a kind of mosaic,  where the viewer is asked to fill in the blanks from missing  elements. We are also anxious to explore how the community  will deal with these developments, and the new ideas that will  emerge from this process.

In order to execute on the above vision, snark.art also describe a "loan" function by virtue of which NFTs can be temporarily transferred back to anyone who wishes to do a screening of the full video. These kind of additional mechanics in NFT contracts are fascinating to study further.
