Of course, I created this book of poetry, so anything I write on this note will be extremely biased. Therefore, I'll stick only to the mechanics.

1. Each poem is "found" in [The Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/).
2. Poems are collected into chapters, each of which is an NFT.
3. The NFT points to an HTML doc stored in Arweave, which it fetches and renders on [the website](https://finding.thebluebook.co.za).
4. The "guardian" of each NFT can update the tokenURI to point to anything they like.

This means that the book can be adapted to show anything which the guardians feel is appropriate. It plays with the notion of "permanence" and uses the criticism that NFTs are only symbolic pointers - often to places which tend to disappear - and uses this to make a deeper artistic statement.

In general, the goal of this work is to turn any transaction associated with it into an artistic statement.
