There are a lot of videos in the syllabus. [Here is a YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ClmaG2tnPMxUf0IYoekTGweKlc0jLOI) of everything there is, so you can see it all at a glance.

I've done this a few times before for other books I've written: [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ClmaG2tnPNgqWDBGCWAQxD0sYpbfPRK), [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ClmaG2tnPOSeeVkPwtLIh5UjjFHcTKj) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ClmaG2tnPM3sgzhHmEhxitzdX0latyD). You'll probably see some overlap between these lists. In particular, I am fascinated by the way we can - like Douglas Engelbart, but with worse tools - construct multiple different views over the same data, each of which is relevant to the person looking and the context from which they're looking. I tried to explain some of this [here](https://thebluebook.co.za/fugue-i/). Like Bret Victor, I'm after the unimaginable latitudes, and [Media for Thinking the Unthinkable](https://vimeo.com/67076984). Once you understand, [just dance](https://www.kernel.community/en/build/dance/inspiration) and be thankful.

If it all makes you somewhat anxious, just watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oohg3LZd898&t=1344s) instead.

You can find two more gifts from people we love [here](https://vimeo.com/483691027) and [here](https://vimeo.com/198949676) to open this note up as it ends...
