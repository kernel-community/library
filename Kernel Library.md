Welcome to the Kernel Library: a public collection of knowledge, intended for wise and wide use.

This website is only one of many possible interfaces. We encourage you to [clone the notes](https://github.com/kernel-community/library) onto your own machine. This way, you can extend our knowledge and help us find wisdom together. You are [free](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/freedom/) to keep your work to yourself, or contribute it back and have it appear here: it's your choice.

Our [top-level website](https://kernel.community) is a **garden**: it is cultivated, and it changes slowly. Contributing requires skill. Our community chat is a **stream**, and it flows quickly. Contributing requires requires access and awareness. This library is the **patch of open grass near a stream**.

We collect here our working notes on various topics that interest us. They need not be as polished or coherent as the website is. Anyone may contribute: either send us a PR in the repo linked above (preferred) or send a document to hello[at]kernel.community with your additions.

## Structure
There is a "[[Highlights]]" folder for the most insightful, surprising, diverse, and interesting notes. For instance, you might find [[Videos]] from the syllabus, or [[Texts]] that inspired it.

There are topic-specific folders - like [[DeFi]], [[NFTs]] and [[Infrastructure]] - for those who are going through more focused paths in Kernel and want to build shared knowledge bases which can benefit the people who follow in your tracks.

There is also a [[Kernel AI]] folder, which contains directions on how to use our conversational model, as well as examples of good prompts to help you learn how to engage it in more meaningful dialogue, as well as a page for collecting insights about topics to which the model is currently unresponsive.

## Purpose

*But thou, meek lover of the good!  
Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.* - Emerson, [Brahma](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45868/brahma-56d225936127b)  
  
  
What is truth?  
  
It is not facts, not values,  
not verification, not experience,  
not insight, intuition, induction,  
eduction, erudition, elucidation.  
It's not fancy words, nor is it  
barefoot lines like this.  
It's not that, thou, nor art.  
It's not what you think it is.  
  
You are not who you think you are.  
  
It's like being touched with  
a taste of life's scented harmony,  
seen through a unified sense  
by virtue of imaginal habits  
memory has made over millenia  
of being born forgetful.  
  
And it's not like that at all.  
It's not simile, it's not [metaphor](https://andytudhope.africa/soul/).  
It's more.  
  
Love so much greater,  
it goes to the end of time  
and still wonders on.
